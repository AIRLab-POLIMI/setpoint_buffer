# setpoint_buffer
Here is the first versions of the translated files (still some problems though) 
Here you will find three files required to start the drone: 
- setpoint_buffer.py -> main file -> run python3 setpoin_buffer.py to start everything 
- guidance_library.py -> calls attitude and is called in setpoint_buffer (still has some issues though) 
- attitude_library.py
